        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan over a low heat, then add the onion along with a generous pinch of salt. Fry gently for 12-15 mins or until the onion has softened and is turning translucent. Add the garlic and fry for a further min. Tip in the tomatoes and purée along with the bay, oregano and sugar. Bring to the boil and lower the heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 30-35 mins or until thickened and reduced. Season. For a really smooth sauce, blitz with a stick blender, otherwise leave as is.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Stir the basil into the sauce. The sauce will cover 4-6 large pizza bases. <em>Keeps well in the fridge for 1 week or stored in a container in the freezer.</em></li>
